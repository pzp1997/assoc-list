{-| An [association list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_list) is a
list of tuples that map unique keys to values. The keys can be of any type (so
long as it has a reasonable definition for equality). This includes pretty
much everything except for functions and things that contain functions.

All functions in this module are "stack safe," which means that your program
won't crash from recursing over large association lists. You can read
Evan Czaplicki's
[document on tail-call elimination](https://github.com/evancz/functional-programming-in-elm/blob/master/recursion/tail-call-elimination.md)

Dictionaries are defined to be equal when they have identical key-value pairs
where keys and values are compared using the built-in equality operator.

You should almost never use the built-in equality operator to compare
dictionaries from this module since association lists have no canonical form.

consider using `get` in conjunction with `insert` instead.)

-- COMBINE


{-| Combine two dictionaries. If there is a collision, preference is given
to the first dictionary.

If you are using this module as an ordered dictionary, the ordering of the
output dictionary will be all the entries of the first dictionary (from most
recently inserted to least recently inserted) followed by all the entries of
the second dictionary (from most recently inserted to least recently inserted).

{-| The most general way of combining two dictionaries. You provide three
accumulators for when a given key appears:

1.  Only in the left dictionary.
2.  In both dictionaries.
3.  Only in the right dictionary.

You then traverse all the keys in the following order, building up whatever
you want:

1.  All the keys that appear only in the right dictionary from least
    recently inserted to most recently inserted.
2.  All the keys in the left dictionary from least recently inserted to most
    recently inserted (without regard to whether they appear only in the left
    dictionary or in both dictionaries).
